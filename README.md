a battleship game in C++

My introductory CS teacher had our class make a battleship game in Python. He provided some starting code so we didn't have to write the whole thing ourselves but it was still fun nevertheless. I'm looking to use C++ to try out some game development for funsies so I thought it would be good practice to recreate this battleship game I did in Python in C++ to get a hold of the language.
